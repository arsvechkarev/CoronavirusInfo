    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans,
    several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
    severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
  </string>
  <string name="a2">
    COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and
    disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019
  </string>
  <string name="a3">
    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches
    and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and
    begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don’t feel unwell.
    Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
    every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
    and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more
    likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention
  </string>
  <string name="a4">
    People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person
    through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or
    exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
    by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch
    COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
    This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick
  </string>
  <string name="a5">
    • Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
    \n• Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
    \n• Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
    \n• Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
    \n• Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
    \n• Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
  </string>
  <string name="a6">
    The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
    For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places
    around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
    these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking
    vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
    restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will
    reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19

    No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused
    by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or
    treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection
  </string>
  <string name="a10">
    While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19,
    there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend
    self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However,
    there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will
    continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available
  </string>
  <string name="a11">
    Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019.
    However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be
    hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care
  </string>
  <string name="a13">
    Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone
    who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after
    someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges
    people to use masks wisely
  </string>
  <string name="a15">
    The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of
    the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly
    around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available
  </string>
  <string name="a20">
    The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:
    \n\n• Smoking
    \n• Wearing multiple masks
    \n• Taking antibiotics
  </string>
  <string name="a21">
    Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. All available
    evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2
    virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically
    related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations.
    MERS-CoV also belongs to this group, but is less closely related
  </string>
  <string name="a23">
    There is currently no evidence to confirm or disprove that COVID-19 virus can be transmitted through
    coins or banknotes. However, respiratory droplets expelled from an infected person can contaminate and
    persist on surfaces. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly after touching any frequently-touched
    surface or object, including coins or banknotes. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose, if
    your hands are not cleaned
  </string>
  <string name="a24">
    When grocery shopping, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and avoid touching your eyes, mouth
    and nose. If possible, sanitize the handles of shopping trolleys or baskets before shopping. Once home,
    wash your hands thoroughly and also after handling and storing your purchased products. There is
    currently no confirmed case of COVID-19 transmitted through food or food packaging
  </string>
  <string name="a26">
    The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person
    coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or
    surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has
    COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before
    washing your hands
