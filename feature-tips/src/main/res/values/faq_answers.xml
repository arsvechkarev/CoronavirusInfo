    COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and
    disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019
  </string>
  <string name="a3">
    People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person
    through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or
    exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19
    by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch
    COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
    This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick

  <string name="a4">
    The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
    For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places
    around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,
    these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking
    vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local
    restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will
    reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19

    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches
    and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and
    begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don’t feel unwell.
    Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
    every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people,
    and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more
    likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention
  </string>
  <string name="a6">
    The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can
    range from 1-14 days. This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home
    and stay away from others, for 14 days, in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where
    testing is not easily available.

    While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19,
    there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend
    self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However,
    there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will
    continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available

    • Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.
    \n• Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
    \n• Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
    \n• Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
    \n• Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
    \n• Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
